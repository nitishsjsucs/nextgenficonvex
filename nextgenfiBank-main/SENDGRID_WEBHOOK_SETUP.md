# SendGrid Webhook Setup Guide

This guide explains how to configure SendGrid webhooks to track email events and display real-time statistics in your dashboard.

## üéØ **Webhook Endpoint**

Your webhook endpoint is ready at:
```
https://yourdomain.com/api/sendgrid/webhook
```

For local development:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/sendgrid/webhook
```

## üìã **SendGrid Configuration Steps**

### 1. **Access SendGrid Dashboard**
1. Log in to your SendGrid account
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Mail Settings** ‚Üí **Event Webhook**

### 2. **Configure Webhook Settings**
1. **HTTP POST URL**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/sendgrid/webhook`
2. **HTTP POST URL Test**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/sendgrid/webhook` (for testing)

### 3. **Enable Event Types**
Select the following events to track:
- ‚úÖ **Processed** - Email received and ready to be delivered
- ‚úÖ **Delivered** - Email was successfully delivered

The webhook expects these custom arguments in your email sends:
```javascript
custom_args: {
  userId: "recipient@example.com",
  campaignId: "weather_campaign_001", 
  weatherEventId: "bd_weather_001", // For weather campaigns
  earthquakeId: "eq_001", // For earthquake campaigns
  riskLevel: "high",
  emailType: "weather-insurance-campaign" // or "earthquake-insurance-campaign"
}
```

### 5. **Test Configuration**
1. Click **Test Your Integration**
2. SendGrid will send a test POST request to your webhook
3. Check your application logs for the test event

## üîß **Testing Locally**

### **Option 1: Use the Test Script**
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-webhook.ts
```

This script sends sample events to test your webhook locally.

### **Option 2: Manual Testing**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/sendgrid/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[
    {
      "email": "test@example.com",
      "timestamp": 1695123456,
      "event": "processed",
      "sg_message_id": "test_001",
      "unique_args": {
        "userId": "test@example.com",
        "campaignId": "test_campaign",
        "riskLevel": "high",
        "emailType": "weather-insurance-campaign"
      }
    }
  ]'
```

## üìä **Email Statistics API**

## üöÄ **Production Deployment**

### **1. Update Webhook URL**
Change the webhook URL in SendGrid to your production domain:

https://yourdomain.com/api/sendgrid/webhook
```

### **2. Environment Variables**
Ensure these are set in production:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=your_production_database_url
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
```

### **3. SSL Certificate**
SendGrid requires HTTPS for production webhooks. Ensure your domain has a valid SSL certificate.

## üîç **Monitoring & Debugging**

### **Check Webhook Status**
```bash
GET /api/sendgrid/webhook
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM email_event 
ORDER BY timestamp DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```
